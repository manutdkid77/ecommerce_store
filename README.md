# Ecommerce Store

This is a complete e-commerce store that will communicate with Paypal to send requests for processing and will also receive data back to the admin for sale reporting.

This was one of my early projects when I was learning PHP. So I used procedural concepts and the code isn't properly organised.

## Goal
Improve PHP and MySQL skills
Integrate with Paypal API

##Tech Used
1. [Paypal API](https://developer.paypal.com/)
2. Backend: PHP and MySQL 
3. FrontEnd: HTML,CSS, JS with jQuery

##RoadMap
1. Convert the entire project using OOP concepts
2. Improve the front end.
